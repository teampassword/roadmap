# Scout Roadmap

This is the public product roadmap for [TeamPassword](https://teampassword.com), simple and secure password sharing for teams!. 

How this works:

* Review existing suggestions and ideas via [issues](https://github.com/teampassword/roadmap/issues).
* If you're interested an issue, give it a üëç. We'll update progress on the issue and mention you when the feature is ready.
* If you don't see your idea, create a new issue.
* Issue progression is done via labels:
  * [soon](https://github.com/teampassword/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22soon%22) - work will begin shortly.
  * [in progress](https://github.com/teampassword/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22in+progress%22) - we've started work.
  * [tech preview](https://github.com/teampassword/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Tech+Preview%22) - the issue is available with rough edges
* When an issue is polished, we'll close it.
